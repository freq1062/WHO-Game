# WHO-Game
A game I made for my Grade 10 final performance task in P5.js. 

Since P5.js isn't the same as pure JS and HTML I doubt it works there, but sometime in the future I might use REACT.JS to make a playable application. 

In the program, I learned how to make a box collision system, how to make a character which turns towards your mouse, how to make very simple AIs for the enemies, how to make an inventory system, item system, text array system like in Undertale/Deltarune, and movement. In the future I would want to make a bigger map instead of rooms, with camera movement and I did make a small test for that later on in my p5.js profile, found at https://editor.p5js.org/freq/sketches All the actually finished/alright projects are under collections > decent projects, including this one.
