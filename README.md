# WHO-Game

**A singleplayer game about fighting off the Coronavirus variants.** I made this for my Grade 10 final performance task in P5.js.

Can you find the hidden trophy?

## What I learned

Since P5.js isn't the same as pure JS and HTML I doubt it works there, but sometime in the future I might use REACT.JS to make a playable application. Also, the teacher said that I was not allowed to use classes in this game which is why there's just tons of objects everywhere.

In the program, I learned how to make a box collision system, how to make a character which turns towards your mouse, how to make very simple AIs for the enemies, how to make an inventory system, item system, text array system like in Undertale/Deltarune, and movement. In the future I would want to make a bigger map instead of rooms, with camera movement and I did make a small test for that later on in my [p5.js profile](https://editor.p5js.org/freq/collections/egH9gjZWB).
